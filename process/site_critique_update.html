	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>I think it is good it is spread out and topics that should be on a website are there.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>Good the in page links work to take you downwards. The external links also work.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>I think some text may too small in comparison to the other things on the page</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>I like the simplistic color scheme and design</p>
